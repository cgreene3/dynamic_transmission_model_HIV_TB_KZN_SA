# Impact of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy for HIV-Infected Adults in South Africa: A Compartmental Epidemiological Model

This  compartmental  model  evaluates  the  impacts  of  different  strategies  to  provide  isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) to prevent tuberculosis (TB) among people living with HIV (PLHIV). The model was developed in the context of rural KwaZulu-Natal,  South Africa for the Delivery Optimization for Antiretroviral Therapy study (DO ART). This model was adapted from Dowdy, David W., et al. (2014) who developed a similar model for application in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

# Impact of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy for HIV-Infected Adults in South Africa: A Compartmental Epidemiological Model

We introduce a compartmental model that evaluates the impacts of community based antiretroviral therapy (ART) and isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) to prevent tuberculosis (TB) cases and deaths compared to the standard of care. The model was developed in the context of rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa for the Delivery Optimization for Antiretroviral Therapy study (DO ART). The appendix is stored in the documentation folder.
